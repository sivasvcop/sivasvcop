SUMMARY

Extracting the empirical parameters from the protein crystallographic data to emphasize the protein sub-structure conformational changes. In addition, utilizing these parameters to characterize the residence time of inhibitors in the active site of protein using the MD simulations and addressing some interesting questions - how do proteins recognize and distinguish their binding partners? How tightly and quickly do they bind? What structural changes occur in the protein during the binding? How do mutations affect thermodynamic properties of hydration sites in X-ray crystallographic macro-micromolecules assembly? Role of the crystal water molecules, metal ions and intermolecular forces in this process and their implication to drug design.

I pursued Ph.D. in Pharmacoinformatics under the supervision of Prof. M. Elizabeth Sobhia, NIPER, Mohali, India.

I Pursued M.S. (Pharm.) in Pharmacoinformatics under the supervision of Prof. Prasad V. Bharatam, NIPER, Mohali, India.

EXPERIENCE

In my M.S. Pharm and Doctoral research, I implemented various molecular modelling and digital chemistry studies on various therapeutic targets to design and develop first-in-class and best-in-class molecules from 2013 to 2021 at NIPER, Mohali, India. My passion for science and research boosted me to collaborate with people from multidisciplinary fields to find real answers to unsolved challenging problems in pharmaceutical, biotech and biomedical sciences.
