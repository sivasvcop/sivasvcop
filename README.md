Hello, My name is G. Siva Kumar, I am a molecular modeller, researcher, and academician. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any open positions in your team :). Always eager to discuss with people on research and development topics.
Extracting the empirical parameters from the protein crystallographic data to emphasize the protein sub-structure conformational changes. In addition, utilizing these parameters to characterize the residence time of inhibitors in the active site of protein using the MD simulations and addressing some interesting questions - how do proteins recognize and distinguish their binding partners? How tightly and quickly do they bind? What structural changes occur in the protein during the binding? How do mutations affect thermodynamic properties of hydration sites in X-ray crystallographic macro-micromolecules assembly? Function of the crystal water molecules, metal ions and intermolecular forces in this process and their implication to drug design.

I pursued Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. M. Elizabeth Sobhia, NIPER, Mohali.
